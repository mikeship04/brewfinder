# brewfinder
Welcome to brewfinder!  Our goal is to help you find those delicous cold snacks needed after a long week, or sometimes even a long day.


1. as a User you can find a brewery near you either by state, city, zipcode or all 3. You will be able to rate the brewery and leave a comment that will persist, you will also be able to filter brewery by highest rated.

2. challenges we expect to face are CSS, persistence due to amount of data, filtering through data.

3. breaking the tasks down into smaller pieces and ensuring the core of the website functions before adding additional features.

4. we will be using the following API to complete our goal.
